# Designer's Agency Website

> [!tip]
> its not responsive to mobile screen yet (under development)

This is project is design using [#HTML], [#CSS] , [#JavaScript].

I have brought new idea on it using this website [Designers Agency](https://www.designersagency.org) as design template for me, so that i call my website with the same name.

## Some Issue can't solve (under development)

- the effect image that scale when user scroll down i can't figure how to do that right now.
  solved by: using timer to make image scale after 3 second when website open.

- some issue in responsive right now so i not recommended open this website at any screen small that 1200px.
  not solved yet
